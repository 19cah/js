One way we organize data in real life is to make lists. Let's make one here:

```
Bucket List:
0. Rappel into a cave
1. Take a falconry class
2. Learn to juggle
```

Let's now write this list in JavaScript, as an array:

``` javascript
var bucketList = ['Rappel into a cave',
                  'Take a falconry class',
                  'Learn to juggle'];
```

Arrays are JavaScript's way of making lists. These lists can store different data types and they are ordered, meaning the position of each list item is numbered by JavaScript.

``` js
var bucketList = ['Abraham', 'Carlos', 'James'];

console.log(bucketList);
```

Output:

```
[ 'Abraham', 'Carlos', 'James' ]
```
